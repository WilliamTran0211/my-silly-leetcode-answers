# 🤪 My Silly LeetCode Answers 💡

Welcome to this repository — a personal collection of my LeetCode solutions.

This is **not** a showcase of perfect code, galaxy-brain optimizations, or one-shot AC (Accepted) miracles.
This is a diary of trial, error, retries, and the occasional *"why does this even work?"* moment.

## 📦 What You'll Find Here

* Solutions that **passed**, sometimes after multiple submissions.
* Code that is usually correct, sometimes ugly, occasionally questionable.
* Problems labeled *Easy* that are actually **tricky**, *Medium* that hurt a bit, and *Hard* that hurt a lot.
* Commit history that tells the emotional journey more honestly than the code itself.

## 💡 Philosophy

* If it passes, it passes.
* Readability is nice, correctness is mandatory, sanity is optional.
* Edge cases are the real final boss.
* "Easy" on LeetCode does **not** mean easy in real life.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo is basically a personal storage unit.
I don’t expect anyone to read this. You probably shouldn’t.

These solutions exist so **future-me** can look back and think:
“Ah yes, this problem sucked. And so did my solution… but somehow it worked.”

The code may be unoptimized, inelegant, or held together by questionable decisions.
Sometimes I didn’t even come up with the solution myself — I just read a guide, copied someone else’s code, and made sure I actually understood how it worked.
That still counts in my book.
It passed. That was the goal.

If you somehow ended up here by accident:

* Feel free to browse.
* Feel free to judge (no need to whisper, I don’t care).
* Feel free to leave immediately.

This is just me keeping receipts of my LeetCode journey.
No tutorial. No flex. No responsibility.
